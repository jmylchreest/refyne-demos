        image_urls:
          type: array
          description: |
            Extract ALL image URLs for this step.

            IMPORTANT: Images are NOT in standard markdown format. Instead:
            1. In the body, images appear as placeholders like {{IMG_001}}, {{IMG_002}}, etc.
            2. At the TOP of the content is a YAML frontmatter section (between --- markers)
            3. The frontmatter has an 'images:' section that maps each placeholder to its URL

            Example frontmatter:
            ---
            images:
              IMG_001:
                url: "https://content.instructables.com/abc.jpg"
              IMG_002:
                url: "https://content.instructables.com/def.jpg"
            ---

            To extract images for a step:
            1. Find which {{IMG_XXX}} placeholders appear in that step's content
            2. Look up each placeholder in the frontmatter 'images' section
            3. Extract the 'url' value for each placeholder
            4. Return all URLs as an array

            Include every image URL found in this step - do not skip any images.
